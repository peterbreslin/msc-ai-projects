The sets are randomy picked and are of the same size (with exception of the last set which is slightly smaller) and we make sure that there is no overlap between the sets. The sets are later used to generate the 5 training and associated training sets for the 5-fold cross validation. We will store the sets in a dictionary called 'sets'. For example, for the first fold we will use set1, set2, set3 and set4 to create the training data and set5 is used for the test data. Using our method here, we ensure that each training/test set of the 5 folds will have the same number of known ratings (i.e non-zero elements in the utility matrix)."
